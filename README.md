## üîß Android Configuration & Optimizations

### ProGuard Configuration
ProGuard rules were implemented to optimize the Android APK size and protect the code:

#### Why ProGuard was Created:
1. **APK Size Reduction**: Removes unused code and resources, reducing APK size by 30-50%
2. **Code Obfuscation**: Protects intellectual property by obfuscating class and method names
3. **Performance Optimization**: Optimizes bytecode for better runtime performance
4. **CometChat SDK Protection**: Ensures CometChat classes are properly preserved during obfuscation

#### Key ProGuard Rules Implemented:
```proguard
# Keep CometChat SDK classes
-keep class com.cometchat.** { *; }
-dontwarn com.cometchat.**

# Keep CometChat UI Kit classes
-keep class com.cometchat.chat.uikit.** { *; }
-dontwarn com.cometchat.chat.uikit.**

# Keep JSON related classes for CometChat
-keep class com.google.gson.** { *; }
-keep class org.json.** { *; }
```

### NDK Issues and Solutions

#### Issues Faced:
1. **Native Library Compatibility**: CometChat SDK includes native libraries that required specific NDK version
2. **Architecture Conflicts**: Different device architectures (arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a) caused compatibility issues
3. **Build Failures**: Gradle build failures due to NDK version mismatches

#### Solutions Implemented:

1. **Specified NDK Version**:
```gradle
android {
    ndkVersion = "27.0.12077973"
}
```

2. **Updated Compile SDK**:
```gradle
compileSdk = flutter.compileSdkVersion
targetSdk = flutter.targetSdkVersion
```

3. **Minimum SDK Configuration**:
```gradle
minSdk = 24  // Required for CometChat SDK compatibility
```

4. **Java Compatibility**:
```gradle
compileOptions {
    sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_11
    targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_11
}

kotlinOptions {
    jvmTarget = JavaVersion.VERSION_11.toString()
}
```
